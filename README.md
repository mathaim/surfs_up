# surfs_up
Using SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database and using data retrieved in a Flask app

## 1. Overview
In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop data is sustainable year round, we are comparing weather data from June and December. Using sqlalchemy, we created a query to retrive June and December data from the Date column of the Measurement table of the sqlite file. We then put those temperatures in a list and turned it into a pandas data frame. Lastly, we generated the summary statistics.
